## Overview
This project implements a text generation model using PyTorch, focusing on text summarization. The notebook demonstrates how to fine-tune a pre-trained BART model on the CNN/DailyMail dataset to generate concise summaries of news articles.

## Features
- Fine-tuning of BART (facebook/bart-large-cnn) for text summarization
- Dataset processing with Hugging Face's datasets library
- Implementation of early stopping to prevent overfitting
- ROUGE score evaluation for summary quality assessment
- Sample implementation of a transformer-based summarizer from scratch

## Requirements
- PyTorch
- Transformers
- Datasets
- NLTK
- Rouge
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset
The project uses the CNN/DailyMail dataset (version 3.0.0), a benchmark dataset for text summarization containing news articles paired with human-written summaries.

## Model Architecture
The main implementation uses BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers), a sequence-to-sequence model pre-trained with a denoising objective. The notebook also includes a sample implementation of a transformer-based summarizer built from scratch.

## Training Process
1. Load and preprocess the CNN/DailyMail dataset
2. Fine-tune the pre-trained BART model
3. Implement early stopping based on validation loss
4. Evaluate the model using ROUGE metrics

## Evaluation
The model is evaluated using ROUGE scores:
- ROUGE-1: Measures unigram overlap
- ROUGE-2: Measures bigram overlap
- ROUGE-L: Measures longest common subsequence

## Usage
1. Install the required dependencies
2. Run the notebook cells sequentially
3. The trained model is saved as 'bart_summarizer.pt'
4. Use the `generate_summary()` function to create summaries for new articles
