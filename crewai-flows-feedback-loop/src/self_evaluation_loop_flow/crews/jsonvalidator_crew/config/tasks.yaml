  description: >
    Validate the JSON output generated from an SOP document. Ensure that:
    - All steps, substeps, conditions, and actions from the original SOP text are captured.
    - The JSON is syntactically valid and adheres to the expected schema:
      - Keys: `steps`, `substeps`, `conditions`, `actions`, etc., must be present where applicable.
    - Hierarchical relationships between steps, substeps, and conditions are maintained.
    - All rules mentioned in the SOP are represented in the JSON.

    Compare the original SOP text with the JSON to ensure completeness.
    Provide an accuracy score (0-100%) based on how well the JSON captures the SOP.
    If discrepancies are found, provide actionable feedback on how to fix them.

    Your final response must include:
    - Valid: True/False (Is the JSON syntactically valid and schema-compliant?)
    - Accuracy_Score: Numeric score (0-100%)
    - Feedback: List of discrepancies and suggestions for improvement.
